Hi, I’m Sanuwar!
Thanks for stopping by! I’m glad you found your way to my little corner of the internet. Whether you’re here for tech insights, AI experiments, or just curious about my hobbies, I hope you find something interesting and worth your time.

Let me introduce me as an AI nerd and automation engineer who loves building smart, practical solutions that make life easier. With a Ph.D., a curious mind, and a passion for tech, I spend my days wrangling data, exploring GenAI, and occasionally getting lost in a good woodworking project or kayak trip.

Earlier in my career, I built and maintained backend Web APIs, which gave me a strong foundation in software development. I later transitioned into data science, working on model development, fit assessment, and deployment strategies. These days, I’m deep into building Agentic RAG systems — and I feel lucky to have worked across the full spectrum of the AI development lifecycle. This journey has prepared me to tackle complex, real-world challenges with both technical skill and strategic perspective.
