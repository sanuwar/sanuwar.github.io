Customer: "Do you offer enterprise support?"
Bot: "Yes! We provide 24/7 enterprise support with dedicated account managers. 
     I'd be happy to connect you with our enterprise team. 
     What's the best email to reach you at?"
```

### 📊 Automatic Lead Capture

- Extracts names, emails, and phone numbers
- Logs them to Google Sheets with conversation context  
- Timestamps everything for sales team follow-up

### 🔄 Real-Time Knowledge Updates
Add a document to Google Drive → It's instantly available for the chatbot to reference. No manual updates needed!
