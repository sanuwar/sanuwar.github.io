## My Guiding Principles
{: .fade-in}

- **Ethical Responsibility:** Technology should serve humanity, not exploit it.
- **Amplify the Voiceless:** Advocate for those without a megaphone.
- **Courage Over Comfort:** Speak truth to power, even when it's risky.
- **Continuous Learning:** Evolve my approach by listening first, then acting.

## Chapter 1: Grassroots Advocacy (Bangladesh, 2006–2017)
{: .fade-in}

**From Factory Floors to Community Forums**  
Started as an engineer in Bangladesh's garment industry, witnessing worker challenges first-hand; organized "readers' forums" and workshops to promote labor rights and fair wages.

**Building Collective Power**  
Co-founded the Garments Worker Welfare Committee, collaborated with local leaders, and published reports highlighting unsafe conditions including factory closures, mass worker fatalities, and corruption by powerful interests.

**Attacked by an Oppressive Regime**  
During widespread labor unrest, I spoke out on behalf of vulnerable workers. This led to targeted repression—torture, persecution, and general oppression by authorities from 2010 to 2018—resulting in forced job changes, threats, and ultimately relocation to protect my family's safety.

## Chapter 2: Ethical Tech Leadership (United States, 2013–Present)
{: .fade-in}

**Academic Research & Global Recognition**  
Completed a Ph.D. in Consumer & Design Sciences focused on ethical consumerism and labor rights. Published in peer-reviewed journals (e.g., Vaccine); awarded ESRAP Best Research Paper in 2018.

**International Advocacy Through Research**  
Presented findings at conferences and industry forums, influencing policy discussions on fair trade, consumer awareness, and corporate social responsibility.

**Responsible AI & Automation**  
As an Automation & AI enthusiast, I design systems with built-in bias monitoring, observability dashboards, and transparent guardrails that improve healthcare outcomes by process standardization and optimization.

**Leadership & Recognition**  
Architected multi-agent AI frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, N8N) and hold certifications in IBM Data Science, MIT AI Strategy, and SAFe 6. Received Humana’s North Star Award (2021) and Star Award (2023) for continuous learning and process optimization.
