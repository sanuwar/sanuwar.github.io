  <h1 style="margin:0">Hi, I’m Sanuwar 👋</h1>
  <p style="font-size:1.05rem; margin-top:.5rem;">
    Sr. Automation & AI Engineer focused on <strong>agentic RAG</strong>, <strong>LLM evaluation & guardrails</strong>, and <strong>MLOps/CI</strong>.
    I build reliable AI systems that actually ship: eval loops in CI, data/quality gates, and internal copilots that reduce toil.

### What I do in one line
Ship AI features with measurable reliability — from retrieval quality and prompts to evals, regressions, and rollout.

### Experience at a glance
- **Sr. Automation & AI Engineer, Humana (2020—Present):** led AI testing frameworks, agent workflows, dashboards; emphasis on LLM evals, guardrails, and CI integration.  
- **Software Engineer (Backend), Verizon (2018—2020):** APIs, SQL/ORM, reliability.  
- **Ph.D., Consumer & Design Sciences (Auburn):** research design & statistics; published in *Vaccine* and others.

### Focus areas
- Agentic RAG (retrievers, memory, tool-calling), evaluation harnesses (gold sets, judges, regression gates)  
- MLOps/CI for LLM apps (pipelines, canary + offline/online evals, prompt/version control)  
- Vector stores & search (OpenSearch, Pinecone), orchestration (n8n/Flowise), AWS/GCP
