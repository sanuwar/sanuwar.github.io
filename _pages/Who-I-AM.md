<div class="hero-section fade-in">
  <p class="greeting">Hi, I'm Sanuwar ðŸ‘‹</p>
  <p class="tagline">
    A backend engineer who discovered my passion for automation and AI, 
    now specializing in agentic RAG, LLM evaluation and guardrails, 
    and MLOps/CI. I build reliable AI systems that actually ship.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="one-liner fade-in">
  What I do in one line: Ship AI features with measurable reliability â€” from retrieval quality and prompts to evals, regressions, and rollout.

## My Journey
{: .fade-in}

<div class="section-content fade-in">
  <p>
    I started my career as a backend software engineer, building APIs, working with databases, 
    and ensuring system reliability. But as AI began transforming how we build software, I found myself 
    naturally gravitating toward the intersection of engineering and intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
    What began as curiosity about automating repetitive tasks evolved into expertise in AI systems. 
    I navigated from traditional backend development to becoming an expert in automation frameworks, 
    AI evaluation systems, and intelligent agents that can reason, retrieve, and act.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, I specialize in building the infrastructure that makes AI reliable and production-ready â€” 
    the eval loops, quality gates, and guardrails that turn experimental models into shipped features.

## Core Competencies
{: .fade-in}

<div class="fade-in">
  <div class="experience-item">
    <h3>AI & Automation Systems</h3>
    <span class="experience-period">No-Code to Heavy-Code</span>
    <p>
      Built RAG chatbots, agentic AI, and multi-agent systems across the entire spectrum â€” from no-code platforms like Flowise and n8n, to low-code with CrewAI and OpenAI SDK, to heavy-code implementations with AutoGen and LangChain. My approach combines rapid prototyping with production-grade architecture.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="experience-item">
    <h3>Backend Software Development</h3>
    <span class="experience-period">Cross-Platform Expertise</span>
    <p>
      Deep experience building robust REST APIs across both .NET/C# (using Dapper and Entity Framework) and Python/Flask ecosystems. My systematic approach to API design, database optimization, and system reliability stems from rigorous engineering practices honed through diverse technical environments.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="experience-item">
    <h3>Research & Analytics</h3>
    <span class="experience-period">Academic Rigor Meets Industry</span>
    <p>
      Ph.D. expertise in corporate culture, branding, and consumer behavior with advanced modeling using SPSS, AMOS-SEM, and Hayes process models. My international academic training (Auburn University, Sweden) brings methodological rigor and analytical depth to AI evaluation frameworks and data-driven decision making.
