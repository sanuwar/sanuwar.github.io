title: **"ðŸ§  How I Used Multiple LLMs to Evaluate Each Other: A Meta-Judgment Experiment in AI Reasoning"**

date: 2025-08-03

excerpt: "Can AI judge itselfâ€”and its peersâ€”fairly?
I ran a meta-experiment where one AI wrote a challenging question, multiple AIs answered it, and another AI ranked the responses. The results revealed surprising judgment styles, unexpected fairness, and even a hint of algorithmic humility. This simple setup raises big questions about whether LLMs could become reliable evaluatorsâ€”not just generatorsâ€”of complex work."
