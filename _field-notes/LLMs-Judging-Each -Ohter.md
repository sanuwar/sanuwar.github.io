title: "üß† How I Used Multiple LLMs to Evaluate Each Other: A Meta-Judgment Experiment in AI Reasoning"
date: 2025-08-03
excerpt: "Can AI judge itself‚Äîand its peers‚Äîfairly? I ran a meta-experiment where one AI wrote a challenging question, multiple AIs answered it, and another AI ranked the responses. The results revealed surprising judgment styles, unexpected fairness, and even a hint of algorithmic humility. This simple setup raises big questions about whether LLMs could become reliable evaluators‚Äînot just generators‚Äîof complex work."

Can artificial intelligence critique itself? I set out to find out by running a meta-experiment: letting one large language model (LLM) generate a challenging question, having several different LLMs answer it, and then asking yet another LLM to judge those answers‚Äîwithout knowing which model wrote which.

The results were far from trivial. Different AI judges valued different qualities‚Äîsome leaned toward factual precision, others rewarded creative or philosophical insight. Perhaps the most surprising? Most models did not rate their own answers highest, hinting at an unexpected ‚Äúalgorithmic humility.‚Äù

Beyond curiosity, the experiment opens important questions:

  Are distinct ‚Äújudgment styles‚Äù emerging in AI?

  Could AI-to-AI evaluation be more objective than human assessment?

  Should we trust LLMs to grade reasoning, argumentation, or even code?

By combining automated question generation, multi-model answering, blind evaluation, and reasoning analysis, this work offers a glimpse into AI‚Äôs evolving ability not just to produce text‚Äîbut to critically reflect on it.
